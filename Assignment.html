	<blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphynx_cat">
	Sphynx are known for their extroverted behavior. They display a high level of energy, intelligence, curiosity 
	and affection for their owners. They are one of the more dog-like breeds of cats, frequently greeting 
	their owners at the door and are friendly when meeting strangers. Sphynx cats tend to be highly attached to their owners, 
	often demanding large amounts of attention, and if said attention is not given, can get into trouble.
